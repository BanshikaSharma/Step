Overview



To design an AI-based system for screening candidates, we will utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The system will evaluate candidates based on their interview responses and rank them according to their suitability for the job.

Tools and Technology



NLP Library: We will use the NLTK library in Python for text processing and sentiment analysis.
ML Library: We will use the scikit-learn library in Python for machine learning tasks.
Database: We will use a database management system like MySQL to store candidate information and interview responses.


Approach



Data Collection: Collect a dataset of interview responses from candidates.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by tokenizing the text, removing stop words, and stemming the words.
Feature Extraction: Extract features from the preprocessed data using techniques like bag-of-words or TF-IDF.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the extracted features and a labeled dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Candidate Ranking: Use the trained model to rank candidates based on their suitability for the job.
